            We know that there are many factors that can make impact on the university ranking. 
            As a data science student we will do the analysis to find out the factors which affect the world ranking of 
            the universities all over the world. (See:
            <a href="https://studylink.com/international-study-advice/university-rankings-explained/" style="color: blue;">Link</a>) 
            We will analize with the data for 2016 and top universities all over the world.

        <p>Now we will see the top 5 countries having most top 200 world ranking universities. In this bar chart,
            there is a blue dotted line which has been placed as a segrigator of top 5 countries. The y-axis contains
            the country name and the x-axis contains the total number of university of the country. If you place the 
            mouse on each country bar, you can get the university count. Further we will do the analysis for top 5 
            countries to get the best 3 universities of each country.</p>

        <p>From the previous chart we know that USA, UK, Germany, Neatherland and Australia has the most 
            top 200 universities. Let's explore each top 5 countries by changing the dropdown in the Select 
            Country dropdown list. If you place the mouse on each university bar, you can get the university's 
            total score. The x-axis contains the university name and the x-axis contains the total score of 
            the university. Further we will do the analysis for the correlations of different factors 
            on the total score.</p>

        <h2 id="three">Find out the correlation between factors which have impact on total score?</h2>
        <p> Now we are going to do further analysis on 4 factors like - teaching score, research score, citation score
            and international student percentage. These 4 factors may or may not have impact on total score. Let's 
            find out the correlation. If you place the mouse on each dot in the scatter plot, you can get the 
            group of countries with larger circle and other countries fadded. Also you will get the university name 
            if you hover the mouse on a dot. The x-axis contains the total score and the y-axis contains the 
            teaching score. In the next sceane we will analize another important factor "Female percentage",
            and will check the correlation with world ranking.

        <h2 id="four">Do female percentage has impact on world ranking?</h2>
        <p>Let's analize the impact of female percentage on world ranking. The world ranking has divided into 8 
            categories. Hover over each world ranking category in the legend to better understand the trend. The 
            x-axis is referring to the female percentage.

    <p>
        From this narative visualization we can see USA, UK, Germany, Neatherland and Australia has the most 
        top ranking universities. We identified that California Institute of Technology, Stanford University, 
        MassachusettsInstitute of Technology are the top 3 universities in USA. University of Oxford, 
        University ofCambridge, Imperial CollegeLondon are the top 3 universities in UK. LMU Munich, 
        HeidelbergUniversity, Humboldt University ofBerlin are the top 3 universities in Germany. 
        Wageningen University and ResearchCenter, University ofAmsterdam, UtrechtUniversity are the top 3 
        universities in Neatherland and University of Melbourne, AustralianNational University, 
        University ofSydney are the top 3 universities in Australia.
        <br><br>
        We can clearly see that there is a positive correlation between teaching score and total score. Also there 
        is a positive correlation between research score and total score. But there is no correlation between 
        citation score and international student percentage. So we can conclude teaching score and research score 
        are important factor for the better ranking of the university. But citation score and international student 
        percentage has no relation with the total score.

    <h2 id="five">About this Visualization</h2>
    <p>
        This is a narrative visualization created for the CS 416 Data Visualization course. Overview: The 
        above visualization utilizes the interactive slideshow narrative visualization technique, while 
        incorporating hybrid elements of the drill-down technique. Each slide contains guidance on how to 
        interact with the visualization. The structure of the slides guides users from one idea to the next, 
        but there is still room for individual exploration at each stage. We accomplish visual consistency by 
        maintaining uniform elements throughout, introducing a mixture of text, image and chart elements, 
        and having meaningful colors.

        <br><br>

        This visualization assignment asks to find out top 5 countries with best world ranking universities and 
        figure out the best 5 university name. Also what are the factors which are correlated with best world 
        ranking. While I was working on an apache superset dashboard project, I was planning to create a D3 
        visualization project to address the question in a story fashion for the viewers.

        <br><br>

        For example, teaching score and research score is very important for a world ranking but citation and 
        international student percentage is that much important. To show the correlation I have created a scatter 
        plot and pointed out the +ve correlation.

    <h3>Scenes</h3>
    <p>
        The scenes themselves are constructed via HTML id tags. Each scene has a unique id that is linked via the buttons.The “Next/Previous”
        buttons allow users to navigate from scene to scene independently, but the structure helps guide the overall narrative.
        Each scene is composed of a unique chart that highlights its own distinct message.
    </p>
    <h3>Annotations</h3>
    <p>
        Annotations remain consistent on the charts, even throughout changes triggered by the interactions. This allows the user
        to have some grounding on the overall message the visualization is trying to communicate. For example, the annotation
        about a relatively good gas mileage stays consistent throughout the vis transformation from highway mileage to city
        mileage. This can help a user better understand which car makes consistently have good mileage across both parameters.
    </p>
    <h3>Parameters</h3>
    <p>
        The visualizations have a handful of relevant parameters that help the user better explore the data. By interacting with
        JavaScript input features, such as the toggle buttons or the interactive legend in vis2, the user can choose to see
        data about a specific category, or even filter out the datapoints by hovering over world rank categories.
        The user input is used as a parameter that controls what the visualization portrays.
    </p>
    <h3>Triggers</h3>
    <p>
        The triggers are implemented via events and callbacks, such as “mouseover”, “mouseout” and "onChange". When specific html elements
        experience these events, the callback function is invoked, and we can change the visualization with respect to the
        action indicated by the trigger. The example triggers we have here are the buttons and hovering legend.
